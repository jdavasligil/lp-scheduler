<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An efficient and flexible preference based binary staff scheduler for small businesses. Our target demographic is daytime businesses and so the model does not address night-shifts, however, it can be adapted to work with 24-hour businesses with careful consideration.

This capstone project was completed as required course work for Math 464: Linear Optimization under the advisement of Dr. Thomas Asaki at Washington State University.
